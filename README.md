# CSE-3310--Final_Project
The final project that me and my group worked on for our CSE3310 course. It is the SMS (ServeMe System) app which was developed using the Waterfall Model. The SMS app is an app that helps users initiate a 'service request' for their homes or small business (for example, requesting pest control). This app helps put users in contact with service providers. 

Note : The files that I uploaded are just the parts of the project that I have worked on, not the entire project (which means there is no Android code for the project). There are the final submissisons for the project - the test cases, SRA document, and the final project binder itself
